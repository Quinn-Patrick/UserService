# UserService
A Spring Boot, Spring Security backend based on a tutorial by Amigoscode. Uses JWT authentication. It has now been expanded into a chat app with some websocket functionality.

It uses a combination of RESTful endpoints and websockets to provide a realtime chat app while also persisting messages and users to the database.

It also has full password authentication and hashing.
